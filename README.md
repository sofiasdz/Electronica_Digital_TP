#   Project 41-mqtt_00

##  First example of MQTT with ESP32

    A board with 3 external LEDs, 1 internal LED and 1 tact pushbutton using MQTT broker
    The 4 LEDs are toggled and lit by subscrition and the pushbutton closure is published
    It has 2 bit for enumeration so it may be connected till 4 boards with the same program to the same broker
